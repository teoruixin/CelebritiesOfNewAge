        <h2>Unearthing YouTube's Explosive Rise</h2>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which swept across the globe in 2020, reshaped numerous 
            aspects of our lives, from the way we work and socialise, to the way we access 
            and consume information and entertainment. As people around the world found themselves 
            confined to their homes, many turned to online platforms not only as sources of 
            diversion but also as creative outlets and means of connectivity. Content creation has 
            now become one of the biggest industries, building the careers of many famous influencers 
            and celebrities. The rise in unemployment during the pandemic has led to people turning 
            towards content creation to support their lifestyles.<br><br>

            One of the largest and first few platforms for content creation is YouTube, a platform widely
            used amongst all age groups worldwide. Many have turned to YouTube for content creation. We 
            delve into the phenomenon of YouTubeâ€™s meteoric rise, and seek to understand and analyse how 
            global content creators from the most subscribed YouTube channels achieve their success.

        <h2>A Historical Look at YouTube's Category Shifts</h2>
        <p>Back when YouTube was founded, most of the top YouTubers were from the "Entertainment" and
            "Music" categories. The number of top channels creating "Music" content remain at a
            constant high until 2012, where it has been decreasing since then. The number of top channels
            creating "Entertainment" videos have fluctuated through the years. While the number of top channels
            have been high up until 2018, it faced a low in number of top channels in 2009. The number of top 
            channels have also been on a decline since 2019.<br><br>

            From 2011-2012, there has been a spike in number of top channels creating "Gaming" videos which
            then decreased in following years. The number of top channels creating "People & Vlog" videos 
            spiked in 2014. In 2019, there was a small spike in "People & Vlog" top youtube channels, which 
            could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
